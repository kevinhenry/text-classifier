Overview: A key developer skill is the ability to use internet resources effectively. Especially when learning a new topic.

For this lab you’ll be converting an excellent tutorial from a couple years ago. Does it still work? Let’s find out!

NOTE: you don’t have to understand all of the code in the tutorial yet. Get it working first, in the process it will become more familiar.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements
[x] Your task is to create a baseline classification model by following (and modifying when needed) the Practical Text Classification With Python and Keras tutorial into a running Jupyter Notebook.
  - [x] To accomplish your primary task you’ll need install several libraries and external assets.
[x] A big part of this lab is building resilience when faced with an incomplete solution.
[x] Because most of the time that’s what internet is going to give you.

## Implementation Notes
[x] You are only required to build the Baseline Model.
[x] Your project will require several dependencies to be installed. Figure out which ones.
[x] Your project will require downloading external assets to particular locations, and with particular names.
[x] Some example code may cause errors. Troubleshoot the errors and see if you can fix them.
  - [x] Hint - you can

User Acceptance Tests:

[x] No acceptance tests today.
